# SuperAP


The wikipedia project is based on the 'wikipedia game', where the goal is to traverse from one wikipedia page to another using only the hyperlinks contained within the article. I'm trying to make a program that plays the game by finding a route between any two articles. The original goal was to find a good project to incentivize practice with programming in python and also to learn web scraping and other things I hadn't done before. After I started, I did find out that there are several people who have done the same thing before(and much more exciting versions). 


The maze folder is a small project I started over the summer and finished at the start of the year(but forgot to put on github until I was looking through my project folders on my laptop). It randomly generates a small maze, represented by a matrix of open or closed squares, and has a GUI where buttons can be pressed to move around the maze in directions. If the player reaches the edge, they win.
