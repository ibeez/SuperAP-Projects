# SuperAP


The wikipedia project is based on the 'wikipedia game', where the goal is to traverse from one wikipedia page to another using only the hyperlinks contained within the article. I'm trying to make a program that plays the game by finding a route between any two articles. The original goal was to find a good project to incentivize practice with programming in python and also to learn web scraping and other things I hadn't done before. After I started, I did find out that there are several people who have done the same thing before(and much more exciting versions).
